EfficientNet is a family of neural network architectures that have been designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks while using fewer parameters and computational resources than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The key idea behind EfficientNet is to use a compound scaling method to balance the model's depth, width, and resolution in a principled way. This involves scaling the model's width (number of channels) and depth (number of layers) using a fixed scaling coefficient, while scaling the image resolution using a separate scaling coefficient.

By doing this, the EfficientNet models are able to achieve high accuracy on image classification tasks while using fewer parameters and less computational resources than other CNN architectures like ResNet and Inception. In fact, the EfficientNet models achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset in 2019, while being up to 8.4x smaller and requiring up to 6.1x less computation than previous state-of-the-art models.

EfficientNet has also been shown to be effective on a wide range of other computer vision tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image captioning. Its ability to achieve high accuracy with fewer resources makes it a promising architecture for applications in edge computing and other resource-constrained environments.
Here I used it in my competition and got very optimistic results
